# Hi! I'm Kelsey 😀
Pronouns: she/her

I'm a software developer with an interest in developer-friendly code, exploring different ways of approaching familiar problems, and open-source technology. I volunteer co-organize [YEGrb](http://www.yegrb.com), Edmonton's Ruby meetup, and I'm deeply involved with the [Dev Edmonton Society](https://devedmonton.com/), attending every other meetup and event I possibly can (though they're all digital for the time being! 😷).

## My work 👷‍♀️

- Working full-time at IronSight Technologies in Edmonton, Alberta
- Maintaining [YEGrb.com](http://www.yegrb.com)
- Puttering around on some project or another (as I write this: mentoring my code-newbie life partner while she explores a career change to software development)

## Currently learning 📚
*Subject to being very out of date!*

- Functional programming ([Programming Elixir 1.6](https://pragprog.com/titles/elixir16/programming-elixir-1-6/) by Dave Thomas)
- Up next: better refactoring ([Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code](https://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/refactoring-improving-the-design-of/9780134757599-item.html) by Martin Fowler) with the [#dev-books](https://devedmonton-invite.herokuapp.com/) book club
