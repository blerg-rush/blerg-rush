# Hi! I'm Kelsey 😀
Pronouns: she/her

I'm a software developer with an interest in developer-friendly code, exploring different ways of approaching familiar problems, and open-source technology. I volunteer co-organize [YEGrb](http://www.yegrb.com), Edmonton's Ruby meetup, and I'm deeply involved with the [Dev Edmonton Society](https://devedmonton.com/), attending every other meetup and event I possibly can (though they're all digital for the time being! 😷).

## My work 👷‍♀️

- Working full-time at Vertical City in Edmonton, Alberta
- Maintaining [YEGrb.com](http://www.yegrb.com) and co-organizing the Edmonton Ruby Meetup
- Puttering around on some project or another (as I write this: building a tailored Discord bot in Python for an online community)

## Currently learning 📚
*Subject to being very out of date!*

- Rails app optimization ([The Complete Guide to Rails Performance](https://www.railsspeed.com/) by Nate Berkopec)
- TBD!
