# Hi! I'm Kelsey 😀
Pronouns: she/her

I'm a software developer with an interest in developer-friendly code, exploring different ways of approaching familiar problems, and open-source technology. For two years, I volunteer co-organized [YEGrb](http://www.yegrb.com), Edmonton's Ruby meetup, and I've recently stepped down to free up time to decompress and re-assess.

## My work 👷‍♀️

- Working full-time at Vertical City in Edmonton, Alberta
- Puttering around on some project or another
- (former) Maintaining [YEGrb.com](http://www.yegrb.com) and co-organizing the Edmonton Ruby Meetup

## Currently learning 📚
*Subject to being very out of date!*

- OOP design patterns ([Head First Design Patterns](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/9781492077992/) by Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Robson)
- Playing with [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/) in Rails 7 (🔥)
